# Analog VLSI Project: Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) and Digital Components

This project focuses on the design, layout, and simulation of an **Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC)** in VLSI using CMOS technology, alongside digital components such as priority encoders, frequency dividers, and D-Flip-Flops. The project was built and tested through a series of simulations to ensure accurate digital conversion and timing.

## Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to design an ADC that converts analog signals to digital form for processing, and to integrate this with digital circuits for encoding and signal management. All components and the entire system were also laid out at the transistor level using CMOS technology to ensure real-world applicability and manufacturability.

### Key Components:

1. **Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC)**: Converts analog input signals into digital output. It uses a chain of comparator amplifiers and resistors to sample the input signal and output a digital value based on the signal's magnitude.
2. **Priority Encoder**: Selects the most significant active bit from the ADC output and encodes it into a smaller binary number.
3. **Clock Generator**: Provides clock signals to synchronize the operations of the digital components.
4. **Frequency Divider**: Reduces the frequency of the clock signal, creating multiple lower frequency signals for different components.
5. **D-Flip-Flop**: Stores data and ensures that outputs remain stable during clock transitions.
6. **Inverter**: Performs logic inversion on signals.
7. **Decoder**: Converts binary values into corresponding signals to activate different parts of the system.

### Layout Design

The layout for each component and the entire system was meticulously designed using standard CMOS technology, ensuring proper placement and routing of transistors for optimal performance. The layouts were verified through design rule checks (DRC) and layout-versus-schematic (LVS) to ensure they matched the schematic design.

- **ADC Layout**: The ADC layout includes comparators and resistor networks to convert the input analog signal to a digital form. Proper spacing and alignment of transistors were ensured for minimal noise interference.
- **Priority Encoder Layout**: Designed with a focus on minimizing delay by optimizing the transistor sizing and routing paths.
- **Clock and Frequency Divider Layout**: The clock and frequency divider circuits were laid out to ensure stable operation, with special attention to minimizing power consumption and reducing propagation delay.
- **D-Flip-Flop Layout**: A compact layout design that ensures the flip-flop operates at high speed without timing violations.
- **System Layout**: The entire system was integrated into a cohesive layout, ensuring that all components communicate correctly, with well-placed interconnects and minimal parasitic capacitance.
