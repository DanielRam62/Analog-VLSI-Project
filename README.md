# Analog-VLSI-Project
This project focuses on the design and simulation of an **Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC)** in VLSI using CMOS technology, alongside digital components such as priority encoders, frequency dividers, and D-Flip-Flops. The project was built and tested through a series of simulations to ensure accurate digital conversion and timing.
